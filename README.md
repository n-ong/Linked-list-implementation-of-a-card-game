# Linked-list-implementation-of-a-card-game
Alice and Bob are playing a game a bit like Go Fish, although neither of them is very good at it. Rather than randomly guessing what card the other person has, they take turns to find a matching card. Each player goes through their list of cards in order and asks the other player to list all of their cards in order until a match is found. The game ends once they do not have any cards in common. Note that they do not draw any new cards during this process.  You have pointed out to Alice and Bob that this game is completely deterministic. They’re not sure what you mean, so you decide to demonstrate by showing that a computer can predict how a game will play out. To do this, you’ll be using a linked list!
